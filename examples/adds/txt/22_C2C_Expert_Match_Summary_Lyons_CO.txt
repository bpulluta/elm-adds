Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Lyons, Colorado
 TA Scope
From July 2023 through January 2024, Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory (LBNL) provided technical input regarding financial models, including ownership by the Town of Lyons (“Lyons”), Colorado, and a third party-owned solar power purchase agreement. LBNL reviewed the federal Production Tax Credit, Investment Tax Credit, and Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) System Advisor Model. LBNL then provided comments on Lyon’s request for proposals. Comments focused on the procurement and technical design of the proposed project.
 Impact
The support offered through Expert Match provided decision support to Lyons during discussions and deliberations with the grant-maker, as well as during the project bidding process. The participant from Lyons stated: “We moved forward with putting out a request for proposal (RFP) for our solar generation and storage facility. Feeling confident that we should try to move      forward with our project.”
 Background
Colorado’s Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) recently advised Lyons that the Renewable and Clean Energy Initiative grant funding they were awarded was being extended to June 2025. Lyons is not sure whether the increased construction costs and the ability to receive the federal Solar Investment Tax Credit still make the project feasible. Lyons sought expert advice on the feasibility of the project and the best combination of solar and energy storage.
