Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Washtenaw, Michigan
 TA Scope
From June through December 2023, Expert Match supported the community by providing design guidance on:
Municipal fleet transition – analyzing the economic and emissions reductions options from transitioning the county’s municipal fleet, which is a mix of light- and medium-duty vehicles 
Funding pathways to support fleet transition efforts – identifying state and federal funding opportunities that can support fleet transition efforts
 Impact
This effort provided technical expertise that will directly inform the electrification of Washtenaw County’s municipal fleet. The community participant stated, “This support provided us with some very important information and data that we can present to our Board of Commissioners when requesting the policy changes and financial backing necessary to complete a fleet transition that is in line with the goals, they mandated in Washtenaw County’s climate action plan. One of the most valuable takeaways for us is that we need to stress the importance of looking beyond MSRP, and instead focus on the total cost of ownership when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of transitioning to EVs.” 

 Background
Washtenaw County, Michigan, has a population of 370,000. The Board of Commissioners of Washtenaw County recently approved the Resilient Washtenaw Climate Action Plan, which calls for an all-electric municipal fleet by 2030. The county is in the very early stages of electrifying its fleet of 244 vehicles with only a few electric vehicles (EVs) in their current fleet and just two chargers county-wide.
