Lawrence, Massachusetts
 TA Scope
From November 2023 through February 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted research on current best practices, strategies, and avenues to address predatory practices within the solar lease industry, including case studies from other relevant industries. This research also provided information on disclosure forms, licensing, and enforcement. 
 Impact
The insights from this study offered a means to empower property owners to protect their rights and facilitate their access to sustainable and renewable energy alternatives.
 Background
The City of Lawrence is grappling with a pressing issue of deceptive and predatory marketing practices within the solar lease industry. Vulnerable property owners are unwittingly entering into long-term, financially burdensome solar lease contracts, depriving them of federal and state incentives for owning their solar rooftop systems. This issue not only exacerbates their energy burden but also obstructs their transition to cleaner, climate-friendly energy solutions like heat pumps and induction cooktops.
