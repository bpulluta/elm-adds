Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Miami-Dade, Florida
 TA Scope
From September 2023 through February 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided TA in two different areas:
Request for Proposals (RFP) Review: Provided detailed review and feedback of Miami-Dade Countyâ€™s Solar RFP 
Evaluation of Proposals: NREL provided guidance on the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal, but due to DOE limitations did not advise which specific proposer to select.
 Impact
Provided Miami-Dade with expert review on their Solar RFP to assist with informed-decision making going forward. 
 Background
The goal of Miami-Dade County's Climate Action Strategy is to drastically increase the number of on-site and off-site renewable energy installations across the county. To lead by example, the local government has been working for years on issuing a Solar RFP to solarize as many community-serving county buildings as possible. The county's Office of Resilience sought Expert Match assistance to evaluate bids received in response to the Solar RFP. The purpose of this initiative is to generate clean, renewable energy to power county operations, reduce county reliance on non-renewable energy sources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to a greener future.
