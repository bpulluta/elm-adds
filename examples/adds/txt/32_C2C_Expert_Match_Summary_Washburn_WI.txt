Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Washburn, Wisconsin
 TA Scope
From August 2023 through January 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL): (1) developed an energy efficiency and weatherization roadmap, (2) facilitated discussions with the local utility, and (3) provided capacity-building on clean energy topics to the applicant. 
 Impact
Technical assistance provided the community with a clear road map of how they can inform other community members on how to conduct energy efficient retrofits and weatherization in Washburn. 

 Background
Washburn, Wisconsin, is a small, rural town of about 2,000 residents. The town used to be a company town for DuPont, which opened an explosives plant outside of town and employed many residents, but when the company left (in 1971), many residents also left. The townâ€™s building stock has aged since then, and today Washburn has many old houses left with property values below the national average. These houses could have a lot of value because the area is becoming popular for tourism and second homes due to its location on Lake Superior.
