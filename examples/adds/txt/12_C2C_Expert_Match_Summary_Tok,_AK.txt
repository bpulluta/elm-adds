Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Tok, Alaska
 TA Scope
From May to October 2023, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) supported the Tanana Chiefs Conference (TCC), a consortium of 39 villages and 37 tribes in Alaska. NREL conducted detailed project economic modeling and component sizing for an envisioned retrofit and helped provide a proof of concept for a power purchase agreement (PPA) model, that was originally scoped through a DOE Office of Indian Energy (DOE-IE) technical assistance (TA) effort. 
NREL worked with TCC to refine the design (component sizing) of one or more of the envisioned retrofits analyzed previously.
NREL worked with TCC to conduct detailed financial modeling of one or more of the envisioned retrofits.
Impact
Since the completion of the previous TA effort, TCC worked on refining a project concept whereby energy produced by a photovoltaic (PV)-battery system will be sold to the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative under a PPA. The Expert Match TA provided a detailed component sizing analysis and financial modeling to better assess the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed PPA concept.  


 Background
Under a DOE-IE funded TA effort, NREL conducted modeling to identify appropriate component size ranges for proposed PV-battery retrofits for three TCC communities. The analysis results included high-level technical and economic performance metrics of the envisioned retrofits. The three communities span a range of sizes, in terms of annual electricity consumption. The results for a given community are broadly applicable to other TCC communities with similar annual consumption.
