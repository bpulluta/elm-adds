Clean Energy to Communities (C2C) Program
Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

New Haven, Connecticut
 TA Scope
From April through December 2023, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and New Haven Clean Cities provided high-level strategic guidance to assess the city’s clean mobility readiness for curbside electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure for low-income and renter households.
 Impact
This technical assistance effort equipped the City of New Haven with data-driven insights to develop their local EV charging zoning ordinance. The program participant stated, “With the program and support of Clean Cities, we’ve nearly completed a draft zoning ordinance. The deliverables we received about lack of access to off-street charging will be helpful in contextualizing our zoning proposal for the public and decision-makers.”

 Background
In 2021, the City of New Haven passed a community electrification resolution, which was focused on electrifying city buildings and transportation. The Office of Climate and Sustainability—within the Mayor’s Office—works with City departments, community organizations, and New Haven residents to develop, advance, and implement citywide climate and sustainability efforts. A growing area of their work focuses on electric vehicle deployment in the city and consideration of broader clean mobility options. The team is also working with the city engineer who has decision-making power in terms of implementing projects.
