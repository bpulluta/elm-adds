Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Teton County, Wyoming

 TA Scope
From July 2023 through March 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided technical support to Teton County, Wyoming, to inform the county’s electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) services. Specifically, the expert team provided technical assistance in support of Teton County’s current clean energy priorities by producing two reports
EVSE Standards Study
NREL provided technical input on current EVSE standards related to charging infrastructure interoperability and data sharing. 
MaaS Standards Study
While NREL did not recommend specific procurement or contract language, the project team provided general guidance on standards that would support development of a MaaS system, allowing customers to reserve and charge electric vehicles through a centralized service.
 Impact
Provided Teton County with relevant standards that they may be included in future contracts with MaaS or EVSE installers to ensure that systems are compatible as the county expands its EV infrastructure.
 Background
Teton County has a population of approximately 25,000. The county is focused on installing EV charging infrastructure and EVSE over the next several years and wants to prepare to procure services in a MaaS framework. They sought input on regulations and guidelines on standards that may be helpful in supporting the charging infrastructure rollout and allow the county to procure MaaS services.
