Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Centennial, Colorado
 TA Scope
From November 2023 through May 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided technical assistance in two different areas:
Solar Techno-Economic Analysis: REoptÂ® techno-economic analysis of solar and solar-plus- storage systems for this building. The scenarios considered include both solar and storage, including rooftop only and rooftop plus parking area solar. The analysis also included a range of financial factors.
Review of Light-Emitting Diode Conversion Costs: An independent analysis of street light conversion costs or review of the contractor audit.
 Impact
This technical assistance effort supported Centennial with the information need to move forward on their streetlight conversion project. The solar analysis equipped Centennial to move forward with solar on their Public Works Facility.  Background
Centennial, Colorado, is in the Denver metropolitan area and has a population of approximately 100,000. The Denver metro area experiences high levels of ozone-causing pollution and has frequent Ozone Action Day Alerts. Centennial would like to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases in the area. The city is interested in exploring installing solar photovoltaics in its Public Works Facility.
