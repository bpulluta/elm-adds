Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Free Union-Piney Woods, North Carolina
 TA Scope
From July 2023 through March 2024, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided technical input for agrivoltaics system design and performed a techno-economic analysis using NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM™) to compare agrivoltaics configurations with specific inputs from the Free Union-Piney Woods, North Carolina, site (Free Union Farm). Outputs compared costs, farmable areas, and electricity generation.
 Impact
Provided valuable insights for agrivoltaics, enabling Free Union-Piney Woods farmers to make informed decisions that enhance sustainable farming practices and foster community development.
 Background
Rural Beacon Initiative (RBI), located in Free Union-Piney Woods, North Carolina, is a social enterprise dedicated to promoting business sustainability and environmental justice. They achieve this through consultancy, strategic convening, and deploying models for practical, scalable community-based solutions, with a focus on increasing ownership diversity in regenerative agriculture and renewable energy supply chains. RBI believes rural communities offer opportunities for innovative climate solutions, exemplified by their Free Union Farm project in rural eastern North Carolina. The 52-acre Sustainability Hub at Free Union Farm serves as a pilot demonstration of regenerative agroforestry, conservation finance, sustainable rural development, and resilient community-based solutions to the climate crisis. Black farmers in the area are increasingly interested in sustainable agriculture, exploring agrivoltaics to revolutionize farming practices by combining solar energy generation with agricultural production.
