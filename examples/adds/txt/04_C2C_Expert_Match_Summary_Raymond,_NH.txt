Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Raymond, New Hampshire
 TA Scope
From April through August 2023, Oak Ridge National Laboratory provided technical support to the Raymond, New Hampshire, planning committee to inform the designs and decisions for a geothermal modeling project. Specifically, the expert team conducted the following tasks:
Assist with geothermal project design
Consulted on a proof-of-concept for clustering around multiple mobile homes with a geothermal system. 
Facilitate conversation with geothermal contractors
When appropriate and as needed, lab experts supported the community in conversations with potential contractors.
This analysis assisted the community in developing proposals for funding opportunities, partnerships, and community engagement to enable them to move into the next steps of this development process. 
 Impact
The technical assistance and engagement with experts were key to informing the design of the geothermal modeling project. According to the expert analysis, if their plans are adopted there will be an overall savings of $1,142/year for 16 homes compared with the baseline heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system and with a 6-year payback period. A member of the community team said the experience was “exceptional” and that they wish they had known “about U.S. DOE activities 25 years ago [as] they might have had a different career.”
 Background
At the end of 2022 the Raymond, New Hampshire, had been working with local industrialists to develop various clean energy projects. They reached out to Expert Match to support them on their planning journey.
