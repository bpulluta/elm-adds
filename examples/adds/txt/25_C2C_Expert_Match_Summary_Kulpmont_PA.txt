Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Kulpmont, Pennsylvania
 TA Scope
At From October 2023 through February 2024, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) provided technical assistance to Kulpmont, a borough in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, in three different areas:
Solar Modeling: Techno-economic solar analysis for three different sites of a system designed to meet borough and sewer authority loads with and without fuel switching
Fuel-Switching Modeling: Building modeling to estimate the cost of switching borough buildings and the sewer authority to electrified heating
Regulatory Review: Analysis of the net energy metering and other utility rules and regulations that impacted siting of the solar facility.

Impact
This technical assistance equipped Kulpmont with the information needed to decide where to site a solar facility, seek bids, and decide whether to pursue electrified heating of their buildings. Kulpmont has been trying to build a solar site since 2016, and the community representative expressed that after receiving Expert Match technical assistance that they “think development of solar is going to go through at this point.”

 Background
Kulpmont is a borough in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, with a population of approximately 3,000. Currently, electricity consumption makes up more than 10% of the borough’s annual budget. To address the high cost of energy, Kulpmont Borough is pursuing solar power and electrified heating to reduce energy costs and convert to clean energy.
