Summary of Technical Assistance (TA) Support

Genoa, Illinois
 TA Scope
From May through September 2023, Elevate (with initial support from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)) provided technical expertise on identifying more efficient wastewater treatment processes and guided on potential on-site clean energy and energy efficiency opportunities.
 Impact
This technical assistance helped inform Genoaâ€™s efforts to retrofit and decarbonize its wastewater treatment operations.

 Background
The City of Genoa Public Works Facility including buildings and a wastewater treatment plant were built in 1976 and runs on gas and electric, with two backup generators. The facility has two Hoffman Blowers as backup for its aeration tanks and is interested in getting a backup Turbo Blower, which saves on electrical usage. The facility is in the early stages of proposing a plant expansion to diversify on-site energy sources and this could include clean energy options and some energy efficiency (EE) measures largely through retrofitting as well as new construction. There was a need for expert opinion on clean energy and EE options and best practices for implementation given the current configuration (emphasis on improving efficiency) and expansion of the plant (emphasis on new, clean energy sources).
