[{"role": "user", "content": "What C2C projects took place in the north east USA?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The C2C program has been involved in several projects in the northeastern region of the USA. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Niagara, New York:** The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided technical support to Niagara County from July 2023 through February 2024. The focus was on informing a strategic decision framework centered on electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). The expert team provided technical expertise to county staff, ran EV adoption scenarios, and identified project partners and funding opportunities. This support led to the creation of a cost-effective, equitable strategic decision framework that promotes greater adoption of EVs. (Reference: 11_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Niagara,_NY)\n\n2. **Free Union-Piney Woods, North Carolina:** From July 2023 through March 2024, NREL provided technical input for agrivoltaics system design and performed a techno-economic analysis using NREL\u2019s System Advisor Model (SAM\u2122) to compare agrivoltaics configurations with specific inputs from the Free Union-Piney Woods site. This provided valuable insights for agrivoltaics, enabling local farmers to make informed decisions that enhance sustainable farming practices and foster community development. (Reference: 28_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Free_Union_Pine_Way_NC)\n\nPlease note that while North Carolina is not typically categorized as part of the Northeastern region of the USA, it's included here due to its relative geographical proximity.\n\nFor further details about these projects or others in different regions, please provide more specific queries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What were the main objectives and outcomes of the C2C project in Niagara, New York?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main objectives and outcomes of the C2C project in Niagara, New York were as follows:\n\n**Objectives:**\n\nThe primary goal of the project was to create a strategic decision framework focused on Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The project aimed to outline different pathways to achieve electric vehicle (EV) related objectives through EVSE deployments, assess the feasibility, costs, and benefits of EVSE deployments at existing facilities and parking lots, and identify project partners and funding opportunities to help fund EVSE deployments across the county.\n\n**Key Activities:**\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the expert team from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided technical expertise to county staff. They ran a variety of EV adoption scenarios to determine the number of charging stations needed, the types of charging stations to improve performance and lower costs, and a general spatial distribution of EVSE. They utilized tools such as EVI-Pro Lite and EVI-Equity\u2122 for these analyses.\n\n**Outcomes:**\n\nThe project resulted in providing Niagara County with a strategic decision framework focused on EVSE that is cost-effective, equitable, and promotes greater adoption of EVs. This framework would guide the county's efforts in enhancing the adoption of electric vehicles by providing necessary infrastructure and support.\n\n**Stakeholders and Experts Involved:**\n\nKey stakeholders from NREL included Sika Gadzanku (C2C Expert Match Program Manager, Community Lead), Sophia Garcia-George (Graduate Researcher, Secondary Community Lead), Eric Wood and Andrew Duvall (Mobility Sciences Researchers), and Dong-Yeon Lee (Mobility Equity Researcher). The community team from Niagara County consisted of Savannah Betkowski and Dawn Timm, both Environmental Analysts from the Niagara County Department of Public Works. \n\n(Reference: 11_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Niagara,_NY)\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you give me more details about the strategic decision framework?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, but the specific details about the strategic decision framework for the Niagara, New York, project are not available in the current knowledge base. The fact sheet for this project (11_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Niagara,_NY) mentions the creation of a strategic decision framework centered on Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), but it does not provide detailed information on the framework itself.\n\nTypically, a strategic decision framework is a structured approach to making decisions that align with an organization's overall strategy. It might involve defining objectives, identifying options, analyzing potential outcomes, and evaluating risks and opportunities. In the case of the Niagara project, the framework would have been designed to guide decisions about the deployment of EVSE infrastructure.\n\nIf you're interested in more information about this project or need details about other projects, please provide more specific queries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What best practices for community engagement emerged from the C2C program?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are some of the best practices for community engagement that emerged from the Communities to Clean (C2C) program:\n\n1. **Inclusive and Equitable Engagement:** In Santa Cruz, California, one focus was equitable engagement. The city's climate action manager appreciated the tailored, focused nature of the technical assistance offered by C2C, which was designed to be inclusive and ensure all voices were heard (Reference: 15_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Santa_Cruz,_CA).\n\n2. **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** In Pinellas, Florida, NREL and the Institute for Equitable Development (I4ED) co-created technical input to draft a framework for a potential capacity-building workforce event. This approach allowed for a more nuanced understanding of local needs (Reference: 13_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Pinellas,_FL).\n\n3. **Sharing Best Practices and Building Peer Networks:** In Washington, DC, NREL facilitated discussions between the DC Infrastructure Academy and other solar workforce groups to share best practices and create a peer network. This helped build a community of practice that could support ongoing learning and improvement (Reference: 03_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Washington,DC).\n\n4. **Clear Communication and Regular Updates:** The C2C program emphasized the importance of maintaining regular communication with community stakeholders. For example, in Santa Cruz, California, the technical assistance team held continuous meetings with the climate action manager throughout the process, delivering formal drafts at 30%, 60%, and 90% completion. This ensured transparency and allowed for adjustments based on feedback (Reference: 15_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Santa_Cruz,_CA).\n\n5. **Understanding Local Needs and Opportunities:** In Milwaukee, WI, the city's goals to reduce GHG emissions were met with technical support from NREL, which provided guidance on estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. This was informed by a deep understanding of local needs and opportunities (Reference: 43_C2C_Expert_Match_Summary_Milwaukee,_WI).\n\nIt's important to note that best practices for community engagement can vary depending on the unique characteristics and needs of each community. The practices that work well in one context may need to be adapted for use in another."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about the project in Santa Cruz, CA"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The C2C project in Santa Cruz, California, which ran from June to November 2023, involved a partnership between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the city's sustainability and climate action manager.
